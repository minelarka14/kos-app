### Why are we doing this?

In order to make using EVs more commonplace in singapore, we created this website to make EV useage simpler in Singapore

### What does this do?

This is a simple app that has locations of all EV chargers in Singapore. Users input where they work and where they live at and we generate suitable places for them to park and charge their vehicles, which allows people to charge their vehicles while working and this therefore makes using EVs easier in Singapore.
